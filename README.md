This repository is for the server that alerts contacts through text messages of the user's emergency. I am using Twilio's API to send a message from a default Twilio phone number to a parameterized phone number (along with a message). Rails was probably not the ideal choice as it is very heavy for such a simple endpoint. However, due to time constraints, this was the ultimate choice.
